## The Dragons

[FRC 5881](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5881) The Dragons are [Tech Valley High School’s](https://techvalleyhigh.org) FIRST robotics team. We compete in the FIRST New York Tech Valley Regional Robotics Competition. Our team builds more than robots. We build well-rounded, independent thinkers who work together. Our team is represented by around 15 students from around the capital region, so it takes incredible dedication and support to participate in this club after school and on weekends. TVHS is a small school with a student body of 140. Other schools may have nearly as many students on their robotics team as TVHS has students!

## FIRST Robotics Competition

Combining the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. We call FIRST Robotics Competition the ultimate Sport for the Mind. High-school student participants call it “the hardest fun you’ll ever have.”

Under strict rules, limited time and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team “brand,” hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. It’s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team. Each season ends with an exciting FIRST Championship.
