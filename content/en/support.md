Participation in FIRST is not only demanding, invigorating and fun, but financially challenging as well. The Dragons are not funded by FIRST or any school, so we depend on the generous support of corporate sponsors, local businesses and private contributions. Our annual fund raising goal is $20,000.

## Financial

Our team is committed to providing a high-quality experience for our students, and **never charging dues or fees to participate**. We rely on the generosity of sponsors to help us cover the costs of registration fees, travel expenses, and materials. If you are interested in supporting the Dragons financially, please consider making a donation.

Donations can be made via PayPal to the Tech Valley High School Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Please note that your donation is for the TVHS Dragons Robotics Team. If you would like to make a larger donation, or donate by check, please contact our math teacher Varada Vaughan -- <vvaughan@techvalleyhigh.org>.
