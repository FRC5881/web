Participation in FIRST is not only demanding, invigorating and fun, but financially challenging as well. The Dragons are not funded by FIRST or any school, so we depend on the generous support of corporate sponsors, local businesses and private contributions. Our annual fund raising goal is $20,000.

## Financial

Choose a level that is right for you. In addition to knowing you're helping kids do great things, you contribution will be recognized in the following ways.
