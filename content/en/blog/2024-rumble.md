## Robot Rumble Recap

The Dragons had a rocky start last Saturday the Ballston Spa High School Robot Rumble. In our first match we uncovered numerous wiring issues amounting to a ground-fault, 2 broken power circuits, and a failed solder joint. The team was steadfast and within 2 hours we returned to the field ready to compete!

For the playoffs we were randomly assigned to the 1st alliance, joining our friends from [Shaker High School](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2791) and [Southern Tier Robotics](https://team2053.org/). We ended the day 0-2 in the Finals losing two close back-to-back matches. In addition to Finalist placement we're also walking away with an Innovation Award for our new driving philosophy.

> In a single off-season competition, we showcased our ability to innovate and compete, and we're leaving with a clear understanding of the areas where we need to improve. I couldn’t ask for more, nor could I have asked for a better group of students and mentors to work with.

Last year the biggest issue with our robot was the shooter’s performance. We missed many shots because of aiming or inconsistencies; leading to an overall 50% shooting accuracy. For this offseason we looked at our shooter empirically in order to discover the smallest changes necessary to create a working design. We aim to use these new skills next year. 

> Our old shooter was very simple with wheels on the left and a compression bar on the right. The new shooter mirrored our 2 wheels so that it now shoots straight and with more power and less room for error. This made the shooter quicker to aim and more reliable. We learned more about working together and more people were involved in working on the robot.

> The competition was really high energy and I had a lot of fun having 2 roles, technician and human player. It was fun to see how those roles are integrated into the competition.
